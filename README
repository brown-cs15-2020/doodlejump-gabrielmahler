DoodleJump README

Handin:
	This is my final handin.

Overview:
	I believe I have managed to sucessfully create the Doodle Jump project. Everything works well, I have not,
however, added any bells and whistles (as I was initially planning on), because I didn't have enough time unfortunately.
My Doodle Jump has 7 classes:
	- App, which sets up the stage and lauches the top level class
	- Paneorganizer which sets up used panes
	- Game which containts the vast majority of game logic, including event handlers
	- Constants which contains constants used for the project
	- Platform which defines platforms and methods to work with them
	- Doodle which constructs the doodle and methods to work with it
	- GameOverRect which defines the rectangle, which shows up when the game is over

Design Choices:
	I don't think I have made any unusual design choices - I have followed the handout which didn't give too
much space for own design creativity.	

Known Bugs:
	None.

Hours:
	I think this project could have taken me around 12 hours to complete.
